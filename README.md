This is my Brawlhalla SQL Database Python Interface Assessment made for my Computer Science and Software Engineering class.
It has ten different functions:
0. Quit (Exit the database)
1. Print all Legends (Print all Legend names.)
2. Print all Weapons (Print all Weapon names.)
3. Print all Legends and Weapons (Print all Legend and Weapon names.)
4. Print all Legends and their Weapons (Print all Legends and their two Weapons.)
5. Search for Legends with 1 Weapon (Search for a Legend which has one of your chosen weapons.)
6. Search for Legends with 2 Weapons (Search for a Legend which has two of your chosen weapons.)
7. Add a new Legend (Add a new Legend to the database with your chosen name and two weapons.)
8. Delete a Legend (Delete a Legend from the database by typing its name.)
9. Edit a Legend (Edit a Legend by typing its name and choosing its two new weapons.)
10. Quiz (Take a fun quiz where you guess a Legend's name based on what two weapons it has!)
